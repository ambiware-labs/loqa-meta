# Community Resources

This directory will house guidelines, onboarding materials, and communication templates to support contributors and maintainers.

## Extension Labs

Looking to build or share a skill? Visit [Extension Labs](extension-labs/README.md) for templates, best practices, and the community showcase.

## GitHub Discussions

Discussions are enabled on both [`loqa-core`](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-core/discussions) and [`loqa-meta`](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-meta/discussions). Use the following categories when starting new threads:

- **Announcements** – Core team updates, release notes, roadmap milestones.
- **Ideas** – Feature proposals, architectural suggestions, and workflow improvements.
- **Q&A** – Support questions and troubleshooting help. (Think of this as the “Support” channel.)
- **Show and tell** – Share prototypes, community projects, and integrations.
- **Polls** – Quick community feedback on priorities or design drafts.

Moderators should keep category descriptions in sync with this guide and pin an onboarding message to help first-time posters pick the right channel.
