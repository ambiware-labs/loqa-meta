## Objectives
- Engage hardware vendors, privacy communities, and integrators aligned with Loqa’s values.
- Discover co-marketing and hardware bundle opportunities that support the hybrid open-core model.
- Build a repeatable outreach and tracking process ahead of marketplace launch.

## Target Partner Segments

| Segment | Examples | Value Proposition |

  Subject: Exploring a local-first assistant partnership

  Hi <name>,

  I’m Anna from Ambiware Labs—the team behind Loqa, a local-first, open-core ambient intelligence platform. We noticed your work on <product/community> and think there’s a natural fit. We’d love to explore how Loqa’s privacy-first assistant stack could complement what you’re building.

  A few highlights:
  • MIT-licensed runtime + modular skills (like VS Code extensions)
  • Optional value-add services (managed updates, premium packs) for sustainability
  • Hardware-agnostic: runs across Macs, Minis, Pis, Jetsons—and soon certified bundles

  Could we grab 30 minutes next week to swap notes?

  Thanks,
  Anna

- **One-pager (TODO):** Summarize Loqa for quick partner onboarding.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Populate the pipeline with top 10 targets per segment (include contact emails/social).
2. Draft intro deck + one-pager (link in this folder when complete).
3. Schedule 3–5 exploratory calls in the next quarter.
4. Sync with value-add roadmap (Workstream F) to align offerings before negotiations.

## Success Metrics
- 10 qualified partner conversations by end of Q4 2025.
- 3 partnership pilots (hardware bundle, co-marketing, or service integration).
- Feedback captured in Workstream F and marketplace planning.
