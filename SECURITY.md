# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy applies to all Ambiware Labs open-source projects, including but not limited to:

- [`loqa-core`](https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa-core)
- [`loqa-meta`](https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa-meta)

If you are unsure whether an asset is in scope, please contact us first—do not disclose details publicly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email **security@ambiware.ai** with the following information:

- A detailed description of the issue and the affected component(s)
- Steps to reproduce, proof-of-concept code, or supporting logs if available
- The impact you believe the vulnerability has (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
- Any suggested mitigations or patches (optional)

To help us triage efficiently, avoid filing security issues in public trackers (GitHub Issues, Discussions, etc.).

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
- **Triage:** We will investigate, confirm severity, and keep you updated on progress at least every **7 business days**.
- **Remediation:** We aim to release fixes within **30 days** for high-severity issues. Lower severity items may take longer depending on complexity.
- **Credit:** We are happy to recognize reporters in release notes, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

If you do not hear back within the acknowledgement window, please resend your email—there may have been a delivery issue.

## Safe Harbor

We support coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When you report a vulnerability in good faith and comply with this policy:

- We will not pursue or support legal action related to your research.
- We consider your testing to be authorized, provided you make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, service degradation, or data destruction.

## Out of Scope

The following are generally out of scope for this program:

- Denial-of-service attacks (volumetric or resource exhaustion) that require excessive traffic
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies unless they directly affect Ambiware Labs code
- Social engineering attacks or phishing against Ambiware Labs personnel
- Physical attacks or non-technical testing

## Questions

If you have any questions about this policy or the disclosure process, please contact **security@ambiware.ai**.
