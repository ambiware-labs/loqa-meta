# Loqa Project Governance

## Overview

Loqa is an open-source project developed under the stewardship of Ambiware Labs. This document outlines the governance model and decision-making processes for the project.

## Project Roles

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the overall direction and health of the project. They have write access to repositories and make final decisions on:

- Feature roadmap and priorities
- Architectural decisions
- Release planning
- Community guidelines

Current maintainers:
- Ambiware Labs Core Team

### Contributors

Anyone who contributes code, documentation, or other materials to the project. Contributors:

- Submit pull requests for review
- Participate in discussions
- Report bugs and suggest features
- Help other community members

### Community Members

All users and interested parties who engage with the project through:

- Using Loqa in their projects
- Participating in discussions
- Providing feedback
- Spreading awareness

## Decision Making

### Consensus Process

Most decisions are made through lazy consensus:

1. Proposals are discussed in GitHub issues or discussions
2. If no objections are raised within 72 hours, the proposal is accepted
3. Any maintainer can request additional discussion time

### Major Decisions

Significant changes require an RFC (Request for Comments):

1. Author creates an RFC document in the `/rfcs` directory
2. Community provides feedback for at least one week
3. Maintainers make the final decision based on community input

### Conflict Resolution

When consensus cannot be reached:

1. Extended discussion period (up to 2 weeks)
2. If needed, maintainers vote with simple majority deciding
3. Decision rationale is documented publicly

## Contribution Process

1. **Issues First**: Discuss features or major changes in issues before implementation
2. **Pull Requests**: All changes go through PR review
3. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer must approve PRs
4. **Testing**: Changes must include appropriate tests
5. **Documentation**: Features must be documented

## Code of Conduct

All participants must follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations are handled by maintainers with graduated responses:

1. Private warning
2. Public warning
3. Temporary ban
4. Permanent ban

## Ambiware Labs Relationship

Ambiware Labs:

- Provides core development resources
- Maintains project infrastructure
- Ensures long-term sustainability
- Offers commercial support options
- Develops optional premium features

The core Loqa platform remains open-source under the MIT license.

## Governance Evolution

This governance model will evolve as the project grows. Changes to governance require:

1. RFC proposal
2. 30-day comment period
3. Maintainer approval
4. Documentation in this file
