# Licensing Philosophy

Loqa embraces a **Composable Open Core** model: the runtime and developer tooling remain permissively licensed, while optional value-add offerings fund ongoing development without compromising user agency.

## Core: MIT Licensed Forever

- **Runtime (`loqa-core`)** – MIT license; run, fork, embed without restrictions.
- **Protocols & SDKs** – MIT license to maximize compatibility.
- **Documentation & templates** – Shared openly to encourage experimentation.
- **Skills specification & CLI tools** – MIT license; no feature gating.

## Value-Add Offerings (Optional)

Loqa Studio delivers services that never compromise user control:

| Offering | License / Access | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loqa Cloud (encrypted sync) | Subscription | Opt-in, zero-trust design, end-to-end encryption. |
| Studio bundles (personas, premium skills) | Commercial | Marketplace distribution with creator-defined licensing (OSS encouraged). |
| Managed updates & support | Subscription | Signed releases, SLAs, enterprise onboarding. |
| Pre-flashed hardware kits | Commercial | Convenience hardware with Loqa pre-configured.

These offerings live outside the MIT-licensed core and never disable OSS deployments—our promise of **Ethical Open Core**.

## Contribution Assurance

- Core UX, APIs, and developer experience are guaranteed to stay open.
- Optional services are additive; no cloud dependency is required to run Loqa.
- Community contributions remain MIT-licensed unless an author opts into a different license for marketplace content.
