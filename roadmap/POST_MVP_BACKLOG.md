# Loqa Post-MVP Backlog

This backlog captures the medium-term initiatives scheduled under the **Post-MVP Foundations** milestone. Items originate from the MASTER_SUMMARY synthesis and focus on resilience, adaptability, and sustainable operations.

## Memory & Context
- [ ] Design path for privacy-preserving on-device vector memory feeding planner prompts ([loqa-meta#45](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-meta/issues/45))

## Intelligence & Routing
- [ ] Define dynamic planner model selection between small deterministic and 7–8B fallbacks ([loqa-meta#46](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-meta/issues/46))
- [ ] Map data/program requirements to fine-tune a Loqa-specific ≈3B planner ([loqa-meta#51](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-meta/issues/51))

## Quality & Evaluation
- [ ] Plan HomeBench-based regression suite with replayed voice logs ([loqa-meta#47](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-meta/issues/47))

## Platform & Cloud Strategy
- [ ] Scope optional Loqa Cloud opt-in with encrypted sync guarantees ([loqa-meta#48](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-meta/issues/48))

## Deployment & Ops
- [ ] Produce K3s/MicroK8s deployment profile for Jetson/Pi clusters ([loqa-meta#49](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-meta/issues/49))

## Developer Experience
- [ ] Investigate declarative pipeline DSL for composing sensor→reasoner→actuator flows ([loqa-meta#50](https://github.com/ambiware-labs/loqa-meta/issues/50))

## Cadence & Milestone Exit
- Review progress monthly alongside MVP maintenance board.
- Promote items to active implementation once MVP stability is verified and capacity is available.
