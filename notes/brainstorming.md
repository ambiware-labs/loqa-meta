# Brainstorming Highlights (2025-09-29)

Source: `../brainstorming-session-results.md` (root workspace). Session facilitated by Mary (Business Analyst).

## Language & Metaphors to Reuse
- **Home garden** — skills/plugins as seeds, local ownership, community exchange.
- **Mechanical watch** — precise, modular complications without cloud dependency.
- **Village library** — community-curated knowledge, transparent catalog, offline access.
- **Respectful presence** — assistant stays quiet until helpful; reinforces "privacy as a philosophy" mantra.

## Principles Worth Carrying Forward
- Local learning must be **consent-based** and explainable ("Should I remember this?").
- Transparency artifacts (manifesto, pricing, data policy) are foundational for trust.
- Progressive enhancement mindset: minimal Pi-ready core → additive hardware/skills.
- Community contribution framing: "trade seeds" while keeping sovereignty over data/devices.

## Follow-on Work
- Draft a public-facing privacy & sustainability manifesto (see new loqa-meta issue).
- Explore consent-first local pattern learning tied to vector memory roadmap.
- Reuse metaphors in future copy, governance docs, and community onboarding materials.
